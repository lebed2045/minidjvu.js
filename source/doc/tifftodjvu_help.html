<H2>TIFFtoDjVu: a minimalistic GUI for minidjvu (Windows only)</H2>

<H3>Notes</H3>
<UL>
<LI>TIFFs <I>must</I> be black-and-white, no grayscales/colors.
<LI>Even if it has ".hta" extension, it is still an HTML page.
<LI>"Run" button will only appear/work under Windows.
</UL>

<A name=wholedir>
<H3>File from an input directory</H3>
<P>
Compress all TIFF files in the directory where the picked file lies.
Order is alphabetical.

<A name=outfile>
<H3>Output file</H3>
<P>
The default output file name is the name of the file you picked, but with .djvu extension.
Enter another name here, if you want (relative to the directory where the picked file
dwells).

<A name=aggression>
<H3>Aggression</H3>
<P>
This is the likelihood of substituting one letter image for another.
The bigger the value, the better the compression, but also the higher is the
risk of incorrect substitution. Uncheck the box to compress without losses.

<A name=ppd>
<H3>Pages/dict</H3>

<P>
This option says how much pages should be processed together to form a shared dictionary.
The bigger the value, the better the compression, but also the more time/memory consumed.

<A name=resolution>
<H3>Resolution</H3>

<P>
If the box is checked, then TIFF resolution information is discarded and the resolution
supplied here is used instead.

<A name=resolution>
<H3>Output DjVu indirect</H3>

<P>
Instead of placing pages into a single bundled multipage document output each page
separately and create an index file. This is useful for placing a large document
to a Web server, or if you are going to postprocess the generated files (e. g.
by adding a color background).

<A name=windjview>
<H3>View result with WinDjView</H3>
<P>
This checkbox is enabled only if you have WinDjView installed and TIFFtoDjVu can detect
its location at startup.

<A name=run>
<H3>Run</H3>
<P>
For the "Run" button to work, you need Windows and Internet Explorer.
<P>
Some security-obsessed programs might react aggressively to this little script
(even if it's in an HTA file). If necessary, enable ActiveX support.
