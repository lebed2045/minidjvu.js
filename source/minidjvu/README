This is the source directory for the minidjvu library.

It contains the following subdirectories:

    base    - basic things like bitmaps; all the other code uses the base.
    alg     - various image processing algoritms, including JB2 compression
    formats - support for various bitmap file formats

Sources from `alg' and `formats' do not use each other.


This directory also contains files that couldn't be easily classified to
one of subdirectories:

    version.*  - keeping and returning version information
    compress.* - calling algorithms in the right order to compress
