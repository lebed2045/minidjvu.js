    Patter matching algorithm is adjusted to prevent some undesired
        substitutions (for example, quite different shapes sometimes were unified
        if minidjvu could somewhow link them with a chunk of intermediate forms).
    bugfix: specifying aggression level above 100 actually resulted in producing
        larger files.
    Letter averaging now works also in multipage mode.
    minidjvu now produces multipage DJVU documents (either bundled or indirect)
        when processing images in the multipage mode.
    A new file naming convention for the multipage mode: pages are now generated with the
        same base names as the original images, just the extension is changed to
        'djvu'. A numerical suffix is added to the base name in case of a name clash.
        So the 'pattern' parameter is gone: instead the same command line syntax is used 
        both for single page and multipage mode.
    Localization via gettext (currently doesn't work under Windows) implemented
        and a Russian man page added.
    Configure scripts rewritten from scratch and added to the source tree.
    The minidjvu library has been separated from the executable (once again).
        However under Windows (mingw32) a single statically linked binary is generated
        by default.
    Multipage TIFF files now directly supported.
    The Windows installable package is now called just "minidjvu", as all "friends" are gone.

    bugfix: no more attempts to substitute pictures on multipage compression
    bugfix: no longer writes full paths to INCL chunks
    Memory leaks (hopefully) eliminated.
    Slightly increased aggression.
    A javascripted page illustrating using the most common options;
        under Windows, that will be a GUI (not too pretty, but better than nothing).

    bugfix: new pattern matcher works multipagely
    Letter averaging. Only single-page for now.
        (I'm still not completely convinced that it's the Right Thing.)
    pages-per-dict now defaults to 5.
    Directory layout changed.
    Configure scripts missing. I wonder whether they really should be back.
    (All that's because I have to use Windows due to hardware crash.)

    bugfix: no more "some weird error happened" messages on color TIFFs
    Binaries are built in bin/ now, where they should be
    Experimental multipage compression (cannot bundle pages yet, however)
